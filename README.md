# Wishes Wall ðŸ‘‹

### **Welcome!**
This is my first web3 app on Ethereum with Solidity and Smart Contracts.

### **Course**
Built using the BuildSpace tutorial on smart contracts and web3.
The course I took can be found in the [buildspace Dashboard](https://app.buildspace.so/projects/CO02cf0f1c-f996-4f50-9669-cf945ca3fb0b)!

### **Project**
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat and solidity use case. A **smart contract** was deployed to store wishes that the 
user sends using the **frontend dApp**. 
Users can only assign one vote for each wish. For every vote sent, there is a chance that the user will receive Eth back from the smart contract.
The contract is deployed on Rinkeby test network.

Follow this link to see the final product including the dApp built: [https://web3-wishes-wall.vercel.app/](https://web3-wishes-wall.vercel.app/)

Main files in this repo include:

- `WavePortal.sol` => the main smart contract code in solidity
- `deploy.js` => script to deploy the contract
- `run.js` => script to test transactions to the contract

This project uses the below languages and environments:

- `hardhat`
- `solidity`
- `node.js`
- `javascript`
- `react`
- `tailwindcss`
